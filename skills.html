<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors">ROCK PAPER SCISSORS</a></h4>
<p>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS IS A DEADLY GAME THAT CAN DECIDE YOUR FATE. BE CAREFUL!</p>
<p>RPS can be played with multiple people at once, but I will be explaining how to play with one other person. 
    At the same time, both players must chant "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!" and on "Shoot!", both players must
     show their hand. This hand may either be in the form of a closed fist (rock), an open palm (paper), or a closed
      fist with two fingers out (scissors). Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both
       players choose the same hand, they must go again until one person wins.</p>
